[Objective-C supports Array, Dictionary and Number Literals in OS X 10.8](http://cocoaheads.tumblr.com/post/17757846453/objective-c-literals-for-nsdictionary-nsarray-and)


> _Previously:_

`array = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:a, b, c, nil];`

_Now:_

`array = @[ a, b, c ];`


Ooooh, yes please. Long overdue. Obj-C is probably my favorite dialect of C so far, but some of its syntax is seriously eyeball-smashing.
