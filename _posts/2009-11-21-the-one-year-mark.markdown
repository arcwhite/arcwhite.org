[Ruzkin](http://ruzkin.com) pointed out to me today that I have now been blogging on arcwhite.org for over a year. My updates may have occasionally been patchy and sporadic, but I've managed to post something just about every month at least - I consider that a bit of a win.

So - happy birthday, arcwhite.org!

Coming up in the next few months: Some more big posts about grandiose subject matter, more travel retrospectives, big personal news, a change in theme and plenty more waffle.

To everyone who's been reading, and commenting - and there's more of you than I ever really hoped there would be - thank you!
