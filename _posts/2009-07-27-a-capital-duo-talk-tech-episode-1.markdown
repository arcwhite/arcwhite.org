@klepas and I put together a podcast. It's going to be a bi-weekly sort of affair (or whenever we feel like it). I should note, first up, that the audio quality is pretty terrible. It was a first shot and not one of the three recording devices we used were really up to scratch - we'll definitely have that fixed before next time!

{% audio /audio/01-Grasping-at-straws-Your-Mother.mp3 %}

[(Or download)](/audio/01-Grasping-at-straws-Your-Mother.mp3)



In this episode, we discuss:



	
  1. Recent events in the world of web fonts (proposals to bring more fonts to the web, and the advent of TypeKit)

	
  2. The pronunciation of Opera (Oh-pear-uh? Op-er-rah?)

	
  3. Static vs. Dynamic Website Content Generators

	
  4. OpenAtrium, a new intranet package based on Drupal (which we'll review next time around!)


Turns out ID3 metadata in MP3s is pretty limited - our show notes in the MP3 cut out about a third of the way through. So, here's some useful links:


1. [‘Beautiful Web Typography’ talk slides](http://www.slideshare.net/klepas/beautiful-web-typography-5)
2. [Typekit](http://typekit.com/)
3. [Kernest](http://kernest.com/)
4. [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/)
5. [Development Seed](http://www.developmentseed.org/)
6. [Drupal](http://drupal.org/)
7. [Open Atrium](http://openatrium.com/)
8. [http://klepas.org/](http://klepas.org/)
9. [http://klepas.org/beta](http://klepas.org/beta)

The intro music we used is the opening riff of ‘Fake It’ by Brad Sucks (http://www.bradsucks.net/albums/out_of_it/), licensed CC-BY-SA 3.0 Unported (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).

Since we’re just getting this off the ground we’d love feedback. Feel free to email us - arcwhite@arcwhite.org and klepas@klepas.org.
