Ep. 3! From this week forth we give a quick shout-out of events nearby and around in the web-field that we consider interesting and potentially worth attending on top of the normal bag of news. Otherwise we have a quick chat about the Facebook acquisition of FriendFeed, the new Google Search (beta!) and a brief mention of this week’s über ‘wankism’: a website dedicated to chairs titled ‘chair whore’.

Pascal mentions a short update: his site is live — check it out at [klepas.org](http://klepas.org) — and notes he wants to write a howto/review/info article on using Jekyll from a designer’s perspective.

The main feature this week concerns the recent lively topic of online news media, particularly revolving around Australian media baron [Rupert Murdoch’s ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Murdoch) decision to alter his media conglomerate’s business online model from ad-driven to a pay-subscription model. We discuss more in-depth the problems that print media and online media outlets are running into as of late, particular in monetising an online dissemination model somehow, and whether or not that will fly with today’s web-tuned audiences.

This week’s ‘fuck you’ goes to Sydney Morning Herald (who get no link from me! -Andy) for including advertisements that play music upon page load. Meanwhile, our ‘tip-of-the-cap’ to [Mark Pesce](https://twitter.com/mpesce), [Pia Waugh](http://twitter.com/piawaugh) and Senator [Kate Lundy](http://twitter.com/KateLundy) who we are planning an interview with to discuss the awesome work the two are doing in the open government arena.
