> Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not;  nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will  not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education alone will not;  the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination  alone are omnipotent.
