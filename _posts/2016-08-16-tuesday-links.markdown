Back to Sydney. Good to travel and see my delightful coworkers, but good to be home too.

#### [DEFCON Badge Challenge](http://co9.io/post/148716614744/defcon-24-badge-challenge)

As has been tradition for the past 4 years, I attended DEFCON thanks to (and in honour of) my employers [Bugcrowd](https://bugcrowd.com).

The first year I went I joined a team that was trying to solve the annual badge challenge - the prize for which is a black badge, granting the holder perpetual free entry to DEFCON.

As usual, it was a doozy, and this write-up demonstrates *part* of how difficult it is. Actually being at the event, wanting to see everything, and simultaneously trying to work out what is and what is not a clue makes this puzzle a real head-scratcher.

#### [A-Frame](https://aframe.io)

I continue to experiment (lightly) with VR projects. I have no particular love of javascript, but I do love the web; getting up and running with my Vive and A-Frame only took about 20 minutes ([you'll need an experimental build of Chrome](https://webvr.info/get-chrome/)).

2 hours after that I'd found [aframe-vive-cursor-component](https://github.com/bryik/aframe-vive-cursor-component) and have two fully-functioning Vive controllers in VR. I'm attempting to use that plus [aframe-draw-shader](https://github.com/mayognaise/aframe-draw-shader) to create a whiteboard that a user can draw on, with the goal of making that multi-user and putting it up on Github.

#### [Possible earth-like in orbit of Proxima Centauri](http://www.universetoday.com/130276/earth-like-planet-around-proxima-centauri-discovered/)

Not entirely confirmed yet, but hugely exciting. Finding a planet in the goldilocks zone of such a (relatively) nearby star opens some interesting scientific missions.

Sadly it would [still take us a long time to get there](http://www.universetoday.com/15403/how-long-would-it-take-to-travel-to-the-nearest-star), so short of a complete revolution in physics, massive breakthroughs in fusion technology, or engineering on an unprecedented scale that gives us laser sails, visiting another star system is still just a dream.
