While I was doing some research for my last diatribe, I came across a few heartening/interesting links:

[http://defendingscoundrels.com/2008/10/can-labor-implement-clean-feed.html](http://defendingscoundrels.com/2008/10/can-labor-implement-clean-feed.html) -- Via [Electronics Frontiers Australia](http://www.efa.org.au), Dale Clapperton outlines legal reasons why the Fence won't stand. His whole blog is worth a look.

[http://www.australianit.news.com.au/story/0,27574,24641171-15306,00.html](http://www.australianit.news.com.au/story/0,27574,24641171-15306,00.html) -- Conroy copping flak on Tuesday for being vague about the plan.

I'll keep posting such fun things as I find them. Down with censorship!
