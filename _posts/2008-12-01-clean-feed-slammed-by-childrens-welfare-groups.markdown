Via the [Sydney Morning Herald: ](http://www.smh.com.au/news/home/technology/childrens-welfare-groups-slam-net-filters/2008/11/28/1227491813497.html)


> "Support for the Government's plan to censor the internet has hit rock bottom, with even some children's welfare groups now saying that that the mandatory filters, aimed squarely at protecting kids, are ineffective and a waste of money."


When the people whose job it is to think of the children are telling you that your plan to save the children is wrong and stupid, it's seriously time to give it up.
