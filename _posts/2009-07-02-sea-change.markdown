In about 2 months' time, I'm planning to be in Europe for at least a month. I'll pack up, leave Canberra, and spend 4 weeks kicking back overseas.

I may not come back.

Well, not to Canberra, anyway. I'm feeling a strong urge to relocate, to be somewhere else. There are people that I dearly love in Canberra, but I do not care for it as a city. People tend to be closed off; there's a prevailing attitude of snobbery and affected elitism that I can't abide. In short, there's a lot of pretentious wankers here.

Plus, it's bitterly bloody cold.

I'm considering a shift to Melbourne, where I have a lot of friends and family. It's all very up-in-the-air. Assuming Europe goes ahead, I may simply give up my current place in a share house and make some decisions when I get back.

Time to hit the road.
