I'm off to Europe for a month!

After a gruelling stint of contracting work, I've decided to take a bit of a holiday and go visit my best mate in Prague. While I'm there, we'll also visit Egypt, Germany and the Netherlands. It's going to be a non-stop trip of awesome and adventure!

I'm currently in Sydney, staying with some friends over the weekend. I fly out on Monday morning (depressingly early at that). I visited the Googleplex today - amazing building, very cleverly engineered and a very comfortable looking place to work if ever I saw one.

Hopefully I'll get a chance to blog some more now. :)
